# Text Visibility Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified:
Text was invisible because color was matching or too close to background color.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Global Text Color Override
```css
body, p, span, div, label, a {
    color: #000000 !important;
}

body * {
    color: #000000 !important;
}
```

### 2. Card Text
```css
.card-body {
    color: #000000 !important;
}

.card-body * {
    color: #000000 !important;
}
```

### 3. Bootstrap Overrides
```css
.text-secondary, .text-muted, .text-dark {
    color: #000000 !important;
}
```

### 4. Specific Elements
- All headings: #000000 (pure black)
- All paragraphs: #000000 (pure black)
- All spans: #000000 (pure black)
- All labels: #000000 (pure black)
- All links: #000000 (pure black)

### 5. Exceptions (Where White is Needed)
- Footer text: #ffffff (white on dark background)
- Navbar text: #ffffff (white on gradient)
- Buttons: Specific colors per design

## Result:
✅ ALL text is now PURE BLACK (#000000)
✅ MAXIMUM contrast against light backgrounds
✅ NO visibility issues
